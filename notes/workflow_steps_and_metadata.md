# About 

Here are some ideas about workflow steps, and the kinds of metadata that we might want to capture. 


## Workflow Steps. 

1. Capture the inttial image from camera. 

Metdata that we might capture:

    - date of capture
    - file size 
    - file title 
    - initial capture path? 
    - hash of the image 
    - which roll the image comes from - has to be input 
    - any note from Brendan's notebook - has to be input 
    - what the format of the uncropped image is e.g. 35mm or classic image - probably has to be input. 


2. Cropping the image

We may want to create a contact sheet. 
We may want to try some automatic crop dimentions to try out, with info on what kind of original ofrmat the image is in. 
In any case we will end up with a cropped image, which will be slightly different from the original image

So we will want to capture the following: 
    - crop date 
    - crop dimensions, and maybe crop utilty or algoritim 
    - link to original image 
    - new hash functions of this image 


3. Creating a positive from the negative.
