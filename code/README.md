1. The first file provides functions to interact with a SQLite database. These functions allow a user to list the columns in a specific table of the database and check if a specific column of a certain type exists in that table. It is particularly geared toward working with images.

2. The second file defines a function to create a contact sheet (or montage) of images. The function arranges a series of image thumbnails into a grid. The layout of the grid, size of the thumbnails, and margins can all be specified. The function calculates the dimensions of the resulting image based on these parameters and meticulously arranges and pastes the individual thumbnails into a new, blank image. It handles opening and resizing the individual images as necessary. After creating the contact sheet, the script uses this function to create a contact sheet from all JPG images in the current directory.

3. The third file creates a SQLite database for storing image information such as an image's unique identifier, timestamp, file size, file name, hashed value, amount batch information, etc. It begins by naming and connecting to the database then continues to create two tables "Images" and "FieldDescriptions". These tables are designed to document crucial information about each image stored and the function used to fill the database with the necessary image data.

The files described here all contribute to an archiving application for images, which extracts some metadata about scanned images (like image size, location, capture time, image hash, etc.) and stores them in an SQLite database for easy retrieval and manipulation. Here is a brief description of each file :

1. Image metadata extraction files: These scripts are designed to extract metadata from images and SQLite databases. They use the sqlite3 and PIL libraries to interact with SQLite databases and image files respectively. These include functions to list, add, modify and delete columns in an SQLite database table. There are also functions to extract image metadata such as name, date, path and size.

2. Image manipulation files: This script makes use of PIL to open and manipulate images. Specifically, this file contains a function that creates a contact sheet from a group of filenames.

3. Database manipulation files: These scripts are used for creating an SQLite database for storing information about images. They also include the functionality to insert metadata for each image batch into the database.

4. Batch information retrieval files: These scripts ask the user for information about the photo batch. This is done through console prompts where the user enters the details. This information is then used when updating the SQLite database.

5. YAML file manipulation scripts: The scripts allow the application to read a YAML file, specifically designed to store batch image information. These scripts can create a new YAML file or update an existing file with new batch image data.

6. Image hashing scripts: These scripts are used to get unique hash values from the images, which can be used to quickly compare the images. Both MD5 and Perceptual hashing are used to create the hashes.

7. Image renaming script: This script allows for renaming of image files based on processing steps.

8. Image cropping script : This script allows the cropping of images and saving them to a defined directory. The cropping dimensions can be defined.

These scripts make up an image archiving system by providing the functionalities to extract metadata from images, manipulate images and SQLite databases, retrieve user inputs, interact with YAML files, hashing images, and conduct image processing steps.
