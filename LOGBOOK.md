lots of progress with the help of co-pilot, now have working MD in datasette. 

Am trying out how to get image views in datasetts. 
I tried https://github.com/kracekumar/datasette-render-local-images, but it made datasette return an error, so I am dropping this. 
I'm going to try having a look at https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sqlite/ and https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-media 

This shows how to render customer templates that allow you to view images:
https://datasette.io/tools/dogsheep-photos

This shows you how to input blob data: 

And this shows you how to configre the media plugin to show media:

Some other changes 

- now have the repo using conda env, use:

$ conda activate bm_archive 

- now have a set of scripts for creating the sqlitedb 
- am liberally using sqlite-utils for update the schema, and experimeting with images and blobs.

Looking at hashing functions, had a bit of a problem working with PIL, ended up using the anaconda version of python:
